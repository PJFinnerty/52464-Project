    "### Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of\n",
    "your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is\n",
    "of interest to you in your personal or professional life. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, rather than collect data\n",
    "related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in this project you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note:\n",
    "this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some\n",
    "students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to\n",
    "base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do),\n",
    "but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set. The next section\n",
    "gives an example project idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example project idea\n",
    "\n",
    "As a lecturer I might pick the real-world phenomenon of the performance of students\n",
    "studying a ten-credit module. After some research, I decide that the most interesting\n",
    "variable related to this is the mark a student receives in the module - this is going to be\n",
    "one of my variables (grade).\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon investigation of the problem, I find that the number of hours on average a\n",
    "student studies per week (hours), the number of times they log onto Moodle in the\n",
    "first three weeks of term (logins), and their previous level of degree qualification (qual)\n",
    "are closely related to grade. \n",
    "\n",
    "The hours and grade variables will be non-negative real number with two decimal places, logins will be a non-zero integer and qual will be a categorical variable with four possible values: none, bachelors, masters, or phd.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some online research, I find that full-time post-graduate students study on average four hours per week with a standard deviation of a quarter of an hour and that a normal distribution is an acceptable model of such a variable. Likewise, I investigate the other four variables, and I also look at the relationships between the variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "I devise an algorithm (or method) to generate such a data set, simulating values of the\n",
    "four variables for two-hundred students. I detail all this work in my notebook, and then\n",
    "I add some code in to generate a data set with those properties."

    "## 1.1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to demonstrate the core skills required to simulate random data, using the relevant statistical distributions and form this data into a dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have chosen to centre the simulation on tobacco use across time. Specifically from the years 1950-2019. This decision was made as there is a common misconception that tobacco use, tobacco deaths and tobacco profits are in decline. This view is a result of the government lead restrictions brought introduced in many high-income countries throughout the 2000's and the 2010's. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, in 2003, the World Health Organisation introduced the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) which sought to convince governments across the world to increase restrictions on the tobacco industry. This indeed has been successful in many nations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in countries where there is a strong dependency on the tobacco industry for jobs and exports, there is evidence of tobacco companies using political clout to hold the introductions of restrictions in their tracks. In fact, the tobacco industry is as profitable now as it was during the 20th Century. With a growing population and influence in low-income countries, the tobacco industry is projected to reach a value of $1,124 Billion by 2024 (Cision, 2019).\n",

    "\n",
    "With this in mind, 6 variables have been chosen as being relevant to simulating data for tobacco consumption and prevalence in 3 countries in the 70 year period 1950-2019. The variables and their functions have been listed below in section 1.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The countries that have been chosen for the simulation are India, Indonesia and Austria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 2 below investigates the basis and real-world situation behind the chosen variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 3 details the distribution chosen for this study, the Poisson Distribution - scatterplots and Kernal Density plots of the variables have also been presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in Section 4, each variable is simulated and put together into a dataset that is presented in a cell at the bottom of the notebook."

    "### Variable 1: Country\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison of Trends in Smoking Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "The countries included in this simulation will fall into two categories: Low-income and high-income nations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the low-income category, India and Indonesia have been chosen for the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the high-income category, Austria alone has been chosen. All the countries included have been chosen as they exhibit varying degrees of smoking consumption, tobacco control and lobbying from the tobacco industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will be shown that Indonesia exhibits a high influence of tobacco companies and a low government control rating. As a result, the country has shown a rise in prevalence and consumption of tobacco products. Austria on the other hand shows a trend that is the polar opposite. India exhibits a trend that shows both a high level of government control in recent years and a contradictory slight rise in prevalence. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indonesia\n",
    "\n",
    "The two graphs below display the percentage of smokers in South East Asia and the Indian sub-continent aged 15 and over who smoked in 1. 2007 and 2. 2018 (World Health Organization, Global Health Observatory Data Repository).\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we will look at Indonesia, a low-income country where tobacco lobby influence is said to be strong and where there has prevailed a high level of tobacco consumption for the past 30 years, for a myriad of reasons. Recent studies on smoking in Indonesia point to factors such as a high degree of reliance on the tobacco crop, in conjunction with strong influence from Big Tobacco impeding restrictions as a means to explain the resiliance of the smoking industry. The alarming nature of the situation was clear back in 1999 when Catherine Reynolds noted specific details of the exponential increase in smoking: \n",
    "\n",
    "> * Male participation estimates range from 50% to 85%\n",
    "> * Since 1970–72, per adult consumption of cigarettes (all forms) has more than doubled, from 500 to 1180 per adult\n",
    "> * By 1985, a Jakarta study reported that 49% of boys and 9% of girls aged 10–14 were daily smokers\n",
    "> * By 1995, a health department survey estimated that 22.9% of urban 10 year olds, and 24.8% of rural 10 year olds smoke.\n",
    " \n",
    "This appears to have been viewed with enthusiasm among some Indonesian members of government, as Reynold's notes that an government report issued in 1991 stated: “Prospects for further market growth are considered good. Consumption levels per head of population are low by international standards. . . . A high proportion of Indonesia’s population is in the younger age groups, meaning that the potential population of smokers will be growing rapidly in the next decade at least.” \n",
    "\n",
    "This bears out in the data presented by Our World in Data on smoking prevalence as a percentage of adults over 15 years of age, that shows a rise for Indonesia from 32.9% in 2000 to 39.4% in 2016 (Global Health Observatory Data Repository, 2016)."

    "Keeping this in mind, Indonesia will be utilised as an example of a country where Big Tobacco influence is strong and smoking controls are weak.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### India\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, India is a country that has successfully introduced smoking controls in recent years. In 2003, India overcame challenges in the courts to prevent the introduction of smoke-free public places, restrictions on tobacco advertising and promotion, amongst other measures. Following this, the country joined the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Throughout the 2010's, the government incrementally brought in measures such as warning labels on tobacco products, higher tax on products and an increased power for police to sanction those who break advertising laws (WHO, 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this, the percentage of deaths attributed to smoking, as a share of overall deaths in the country, rose from 7.76% in 1990 to 9.03% in 2017 (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2017). This underpins the reality that control measures have a limit to their potential and are limited in terms of how long it takes for measures to begin to show results. Chhabra et al.(2019) outline that smoking among middle aged adults remains high and among the less educated people and those lvining in rural areas. However, it is noted that the number of young and educated adult smokers has dropped significantly (Chabbra et al., 2019). This can account for the graph of current tobacco use above, whereby, India drops from having 38.5% of the population in 2007 to 27% in 2018. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Austria\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the period 2012-2016, we can get a clear view of the stead trend in reduced smoking prevalence. The figures below are for men and women aged 15 years and over(MacroTrends:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Austria smoking rate for 2016 was 29.60%, a 1% decline from 2015.\n",
    "* Austria smoking rate for 2015 was 30.60%, a 0.8% decline from 2014.\n",
    "* Austria smoking rate for 2014 was 31.40%, a 1% decline from 2013.\n",
    "* Austria smoking rate for 2013 was 32.40%, a 1.2% decline from 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at a broader picture, the trend has been continuing for the past twenty years. In 2001, 43% of Austrian adults (15+) smoked. The female prevalence rate was down to 28% percent in 2016 (Trading Economics). Since 2016, this trend has continued. It has continued as government restrictions on smoking in public places has continued and as taxes have risen. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2018, smoking in cars, cafe's and nightclubs was banned (Vox, 2018), and whilst this is later than many other European states, Austria still exhibits a trend in reduced smoking that is high in comparison to the average. Most of the regulations proposed by the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control were introduced in Austria throughout the 2000's, this seemingly has had an effect on the prevalance and consumption of tobacco. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, Austria is a good country to study the effect of tobacco control. The comparison of Austria with Indonesia, will be useful for the simulation of data in this project."

This was due to the fact that whilst middle-aged people smoked more and were not particularly influenced by government measures, younger people had increasingly chose not to smoke. As can be seen in the graph above, India actually experienced a drop in almost 10% from 2000 to 2016. This is a significant achievement for a low-income country.\n",

    "#### Function of Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "This variable will be a numeric float, between 0 and 5, where a higher number indicates a large degree of government control of tobacco and a low rating indicates little control.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is a simulation, there is no need to collect the necessary data to produce this datapoint. If this were a real-world study, the variable would require a qualitative study of smoking restrictions for the public, smoking bans on advertising, increasing the level of taxes on tobacco sale and finally, whether or not the relevant government had engaged in anti-smoking PR campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Smoking Deaths and the Relationship with Investment in Anti-smoking Campaigs\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past two decades there has been a considerable effort by many developed nations to decrease smoking. This effort has taken many forms. Many countries have hiked taxes that consumers pay on cigarette purchases, in order to both deter people from smoking and to cover the cost of the healtcare that long-term smokers require. Additionally, restrictions have been put on the sale of cigarettes, such as getting rid of branding that tobacco companies are allowed to use. This follows on from laws introduced in the 1990's and 2000's making it illegal to advertise cigarettes to consumers. Finally, campaigns have been launched across Europe, America and in many developing nations (though not all) to highlight the high correlation between smoking and various forms of cancer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a considerable decrease in smoking related deaths for 100,000 of the populations of these countries where restrictions and campaigns were launched. This success should not be diminished - it highlights that a conscious effort can significantly affect the mindset of peoples and also forms part of a greater awareness worldwide of being more aware of what we put into our bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this success however, there is evidence that in some developing nations, where smoking is more prevelant to begin with and where litte has been done in the way of restricting the operations of tobacco combanies in the marketing and sale of product, that smoking related deaths have not decreased, but rather increased. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the sales of the top 5 tobacco companies, or 'Big Tobacco' as they are collectively known as, in some countries these companies have seen an increase in revenues in recent years. Some articles have even highlighted how this is arguably the most profitable time in history for tobacco companies (The Guardian, 2017)."

    "#### Concern Over the Tactics of Tobacco Industry in Low-income Countries\n",
    "\n",
    "In July 2019, a major group responsible for highlighting the consequences of smoking, Ash (or Action on Smoking and Health), opened their report on smoking in developing countries with the following statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Around 1.1 billion people aged 15 and over smoke, with 80% living in LMICs (low and middle income\n",
    "countries). Tobacco growing and consumption have become concentrated in the developing world where\n",
    "the health, economic, and environmental burden is heaviest and likely to increase.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ash's assertment is backed up by data of a surge in Tobacco company profits, studies carried out throghout Africa and Southeast Asia of tactics from 'Big Tobacco' to curtail government efforts to tackle smoking and numerous verified reports of illegal marketing ploys in low-income countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 1984, British American Tobacco (BAT), in association with the International Tobacco Growers’ Association (ITGA), an organisation that was founded to lobby for Big Tobacco, have used varius tactics to pressure low-income countries to abandom restrictions on the growing and sale of Tobacco. Taking Malawi as an example, a country that has a long history of tobacco crop farming. In 1986, a government official pushed back against the World Health Organisation on the issue of tobacco control, on the basis that it would negatively impact the economy of Malawi. Indeed, today tobacco sale accounts for 70% of Malawi's foreign earnings (Mamudu et al., 2009). This economic dependency and the tact of the tobacco lobbies, lead the  International Tobacco Growers’ Association (ITGA) to platform tobacco growers representatives against the bodies of the United Nations responsible for tobacco control. This tactic formed part of a larger strategy, drawing on representatives from the industry in low-income countries and eventually lead to the weakening of the focus on health in the UN's tobacco control narrative (Mamudu et al, 2009).\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017, in an expose on the marketing ploys of Philip Morris in India, Reuters reported that the company responsibe fr the Marlboro brand, breached India's anti-smoking laws. Amongst the many tactics used included the placement of colourful advertisements in kiosks across New Delhi and handing out free cigarettes to young people at parties (Reuters, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "Indonesia is a country where tobacco growing and consumption are notably high and where tobacco companies focus on quelling restrictions. In 2017, it was reported that Indonesia consumed 322 million cigarettes. A survey in 2019 found that curiosity was the primary reason for Indonesians to start smoking, with the average age that a smoker had their first cigarette was 16-18 (Hirschmann, December 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, there is consensus that tobacco lobbying in low-income countries has had a considerble effect on the introduction of even minor forms of tobacco control. A study in 2016 specifically examined the introduction of health warning labels on cigarette packaging. These labels were compliant with the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). They concluded that countries where state capacity were low were less likely to introduce the warning labels (Hiilam and Glantz, 2016). This remains as an ever present issue when it comes to tackling cigarette comsumption globally."

    "In statistics, a Poisson distribution is a statistical distribution that shows how many times an event is likely to occur within a specified period of time. It is used for independent events which occur at a constant rate within a given interval of time (Investopedia, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "In business, the Poisson distribution is widely used to analyse operational efficiency in order to understand what steps can be taken for improved business solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example uses of the Poisson ditribution are in Customer Service staffing, where calculating the maximum number of phone calls that need to be dealt with every hour is a key to meeting customer demand. The distribution is also used in retail to determine whether it is financially viable to keep a store open 24 hours a day (CFI, 2019).\n",

    "#### Appropriateness of the Poisson Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "As this distribtion is used for independent events which occur at a constant rate within a given interval of time, it is an appropriate choice for Variable 3 ('Prevalence', % of poplation that smoke) and Variable 4 ('Consumption', no. of cigarettes consumerd per capita per year).\n",
    "\n",
    "As each row of data in the Smoking Dataset relates to an annual obervation in the range of 1950 to 2019, the events occur at a constant rate. Furthermore, as detailed in Section 2, 'Prevelance' and 'Consumption' as represented in the available data, show enough deviations from other variables to classify them as independent events. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this, there are some considerations about where the Poisson Distribution scenarious arent ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the conditions under which the Poisson Distribution is appropriate (CFI):\n",
    "\n",
    "* k is the number of times an event happens within a specified time period, and the possible values for k are simple numbers such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* No occurrence of the event being analyzed affects the probability of the event re-occurring (events occur independently).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The event in question cannot occur twice at exactly the same time. There must be some interval of time – even if just half a second – that separates occurrences of the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The probability of an event happening within a portion of the total time frame being examined is proportional to the length of that smaller portion of the time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number of trials (chances for the event to occur) is sufficiently greater than the number of times the event does actually occur (in other words, the Poisson Distribution is only designed to be applied to events that occur relatively rarely).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the last condition mentioned above, relating to the number trials being greater than the actualy events, the randomised data in this dataset does not meet this requirement. As we are applying the distribution to the very common act of smoking and the annual stats relating to it, then the events in question do not happen rarely.\n",
